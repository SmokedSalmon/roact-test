> Generated by [Rojo](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo) 7.4.1.

A demo & playground to build GUI elements using [Roact](https://roblox.github.io/roact)

## Why Not react-lua
Although Roact is no longer maintained after **Dec 13, 2023**, it is still the NO.1 declarative Lua GUI library that based on React

It's to-be successor [react-lua](https://github.com/Roblox/react-lua) is a Roblox internal project, yet to be published as ready-to-use package at any public registry. It also features some React 17/18 features such as **concurrent** mode, and therefore may not be of great value for my current projects

> If you really want to use `react-lua`, check out the Community-maintained version - [jsdotlua's react-lua](https://jsdotlua.github.io/react-lua)
